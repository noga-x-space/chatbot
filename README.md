## Technologies Used
### Frontend:

React
Axios
CSS for styling
### Backend:

Node.js with Express.js
Multer for file handling
Python for document parsing (via PyPDF2 and python-docx)

### External Services:

## OpenAI API for chatbot responses

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system:
+ node.js
+ Python
+ vite
+ OpenAI API key 



#### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

```

2. Install Dependencies
Backend:
Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

```makefile
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```
Replace <your-openai-api-key> with your OpenAI API key.


note\*\* if for some reason it doent work try, setting the key each time the session rolls instead:

```powershell
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY = <your key>
```

4. Install Python and Required Libraries
Ensure Python is installed and set up in your system. Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
